My name is Muyan Jiang. I am a PhD student at UC Berkeley’s Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (advisor: <a href="https://aswani.ieor.berkeley.edu/">Anil Aswani</a>) with a designated emphasis in Computational Precision Health (advisor: <a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/maya-petersen/">Maya Petersen</a>).

I completed my undergraduate in New York University, Abu Dhabi, UAE, with a double major in Mathematics and Computer Sciences. 

My education was in a global liberal arts school where I have studied in many places including Abu Dhabi, New York, Turkey, Bulgaria, Sri Lanka, etc. I have taken classes from various disciplines including Mathematics, Computer Sciences, Economy, Astronomy, Biology, Political Sciences, Arabic Language, Photography, etc.

My current research interests lie in the area of personalized data-driven decision-making with applications mostly in healthcare systems, utilizing mathematical modeling and optimization techniques. I aim to develop interpretable machine learning and statistical models for precision interventions using non/semi-parametric representation of time series data.

More broadly speaking, I have experience in research at the intersection of mathematics and computer science. I am generally interested in data science, decision-making, optimization, causal inference, operations research, machine learning/deep learning, etc.

Please refer to my [publications page](/publications/) for details. I am familiar with Python, C/C++, C#, Scope, R, Mathematica, SQL, Julia and many other DL/ML frameworks or platforms.
