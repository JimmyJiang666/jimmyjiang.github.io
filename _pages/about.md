My name is Muyan Jiang. I am a PhD student at UC Berkeley’s Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (advisor: <a href="https://aswani.ieor.berkeley.edu/">Anil Aswani</a>) with a designated emphasis in Computational Precision Health (advisor: <a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/maya-petersen/">Maya Petersen</a>).

I completed my undergraduate in New York University, Abu Dhabi, UAE, with a double major in Mathematics and Computer Sciences. 

My education was in a global liberal arts school where I have studied in many places including Abu Dhabi, New York, Turkey, Bulgaria, Sri Lanka, etc. I have taken classes from various disciplines including Mathematics, Computer Sciences, Economy, Astronomy, Biology, Political Sciences, Arabic Language, Photography, etc.

My current research interests lie in the area of personalized data-driven decision-making with applications mostly in healthcare systems, utilizing mathematical modeling and optimization techniques. I aim to develop interpretable machine learning and statistical models for precision interventions using non/semi-parametric representation of time series data. My recent work focuses on distilling deep hazard models for survival analysis through partial linear model estimation using healthcare data from MIMIC IV.

More broadly speaking, I have experience in research at the intersection of mathematics and computer science. I am generally interested in data science, decision-making, optimization, causal inference, operations research, machine learning/deep learning, etc.

Please refer to my [publications page](/publications/) for details. I am familiar with Python, C/C++, C#, Scope, R, Mathematica, SQL, Julia and many other DL/ML frameworks or platforms.
