My name is Muyan Jiang. I am a PhD student at UC Berkeley’s Industrial Engineering and Operations Research department. I completed my undergraduate in New York University, Abu Dhabi, UAE, with a double major in Mathematics and Computer Sciences. 

My education was in a global liberal arts school where I have studied in many places including Abu Dhabi, New York, Turkey, Bulgaria, Sri Lanka, etc. I have taken classes from various disciplines including Mathematics, Computer Sciences, Economy, Astronomy, Biology, Political Sciences, Arabic Language, Photography, etc.

I have experiences in research at the intersection of mathematics and computer science. I am broadly interested in optimization, decision-making, matrix analysis, epidemiological modeling, operation research, machine learning, Lie (super)algebra, etc. Please refer to my [publications page](/publications/) for details.
