My name is **Muyan Jiang**. I am a PhD candidate in **Industrial Engineering & Operations Research** at UC Berkeley, advised by [Anil Aswani](https://aswani.ieor.berkeley.edu/), with a designated emphasis in **Computational Precision Health** (co-advised by [Maya Petersen](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/maya-petersen/)).  

I hold a BS in Mathematics and Computer Science from New York University Abu Dhabi, where I conducted research in operator theory and matrix analysis, focusing on Kippenhahn curves and numerical ranges of reciprocal matrices under the mentorship of [Ilya Spitkovsky](https://www.math.wm.edu/~ilya/).  

My current research integrates mathematical optimization, machine learning, and statistical modeling to design data-driven solutions for healthcare systems. Specific interests include:  
- **Interpretable ML models** for precision interventions.  
- **Bi-level optimization** in contract design for healthcare payment systems.  
- **Semiparametric regression** for personalized treatment strategies.  

I also have broad expertise in operations research, causal inference, and deep learning, with technical proficiency in Python, C/C++, SQL, Julia, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and cloud platforms like AWS and GCP.
