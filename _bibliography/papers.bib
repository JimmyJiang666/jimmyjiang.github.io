abstract = { We consider tridiagonal matrices (aij)i,j=1n with constant main diagonal and such that ai,i+1ai+1,i=1 for i=1,…,n−1. For these matrices, criteria are established under which their Kippenhahn curves contain elliptical components or even consist completely of such. These criteria are in terms of a system of homogeneous polynomial equations in variables (|aj,j+1|−|aj+1,j|)2, and established via a unified approach across arbitrary dimensions. The results are illustrated, and specific numerical examples are provided for n = 7, thus generalizing earlier work in the lower-dimensional setting. }
